        body: 'Fanny Wertz is the youngest daughter of the Wertz family and the youngest sister of Tigreal. Although the men of the Wertz family served in the army for generations and guarded the Moniyan Empire, the female members of the family were never allowed to join the army. From the perspective of the men in the family, their duty was to protect the country and family from threats, and women were to stay away from war.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'Therefore, ever since she was a child, Fanny had been asked to study painting and design art. The elders of the family hoped that she could become a famous artist or designer, and help manage the family’s business. But Fanny regarded this as beneath her. From ever since she could remember, Tigreal was Fanny’s greatest hero. She also hoped that one day, like her brother, she could fight on the front lines for the Imperial Army and guard the empire.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'After she grew older, the active and rebellious Fanny became a nightmare for her tutor. She was very tired of these old-fashioned classes. She often ran away for various reasons and had a soft spot for dancing with weapons: but Fanny was so smart that even though she was tired of her lessons, she was able to gain an understanding in very short time. Tigreal showed extreme affection to his rebellious sister. Each time Tigreal returned to the Lumina City for repair and maintenance with the army, it was Fanny’s happiest day, because Tigreal would not only tell her some peculiar anecdotes and thrilling battlefield stories from various places, but also teach her some useful fighting skills, which made Fanny yearn even more for the military life.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'However, Tigreal firmly refused Fanny’s desire to join the army as he always did. He did not want his only sister to be in danger.'

        body: 'After the Endless War, the Land of Dawn was covered scars, but the Moonlit Forest of Azrya was still bathed in the light of the Moon Goddess. I addition to the elves, there were various other strange creatures living in this dense forest with a most unrestrained bearing. There were very few disputes.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'Leonins were the most peculiar race in this forest. They were few in number, but they were born with a cute appearance, agile demeanor, and some talent for using spiritual power. They used their spiritual power to bake apple pies, catch fish, and jump around in the woods… So long as the Leonins were awake, the Moonlit Forest was especially lively.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'Nana was the [naughtiest] Leonin among them. She was born on a moonlit night with great spiritual powers. Nana was naturally enthusiastic and energetic, and liked to use her own power to help her friends in the jungle. It is just a pity that she, being rash and reckless, either baked other people’s apple pies to ashes or uprooted the berry bushes. Gradually, everyone began to distance themselves from Nana.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'Fortunately, there was a little Tanuki called Molina who was always by Nana’s side. Molina was a small Tanuki living on the edge of the Moonlit Forest. She had no father, no mother, and no friends. She lived alone ever since she could remember. Owing to an accident, Molina broke into the gathering place of the Leonins, got stuck in a dangerous cave and it was Nana who saved her. Since then, Molina always liked to pester Nana. But Nana didn’t like being with Molina all day long. She felt that Molina, who only had ability to change, was too weak and given that Nana always like to make trouble, felt like Molina shouldn’t always be by her side.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'Nana preferred to play with her fellow Leonins.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'Although she felt disappointed because of everyone’s rejection, Nana, who was naturally optimistic, would soon try to help everyone. One time, the indolent Leonins had a rare get-together and held a discussion about building a playground that would belong to the Leonin race. For the Leonins, this was a rare, serious event, and Nana also enthusiastically participated in it.'

But as his co-founders fell deeper and deeper into their depraved human weaponization experiments, Dr. Baker felt he had no choice but to leave and pursue a new project.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'Renouncing the questionable ethics of human experimentation, he endeavored to create a new kind of life-form, solely from a mechanical skeleton, puppet strings, and synthetic skin, and finally, a new generation of artificial life was born. Dr. Baker firmly believed that love and hope were the greatest inventions of mankind, so he programmed the world\'s most moving stories into the heart of his new creation. One bright morning, Peace Android Prototype 1 awakened from her bed, and Dr. Baker bestowed upon this adorable mechanical angel, the name Angela.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'Angela followed Dr. Baker\'s tutelage, studying hard to understand the world, and hoping to meet the doctor\'s high expectations. However, their peaceful life together was soon cut short. When the mad scientists of Lab 1718 heard rumors that Dr. Baker had created a living soul outside of a human body, they couldn\'t believe it. They convinced themselves that Baker had betrayed them, keeping this knowledge to himself before fleeing, and so they ordered Dr. Baker\'s past creations, Alpha and Beta to hunt down Dr. Baker and his creation. As their pursuers were just about to close in on them, Dr. Baker placed Angela into a flight capsule, instructing her to seek out his good friend Dr. Rooney. However, the flight capsule was struck down a terrible thunderstorm, and landed in a remote corner of the Land of Dawn. Emerging from the wreckage, Angela began her journey to find Dr. Rooney, and save her father.[2]'
